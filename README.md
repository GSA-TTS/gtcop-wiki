# The Geospatial Technology CoP (GtCoP) - Wiki

The **Geospatial Technology Community of Practice (GtCoP)** will facilitate spreading lessons learned in applying modern digital capabilities as well as spreading the courage to change in adopting modern technology management and procurement practices.
- Provide a space for informal information sharing, ideation, and brainstorming necessary to innovate geospatial technologies in government
- Feedback mechanism for geospatial programs across the government to learn about stakeholder and user needs
- Share best technical practices related to digital modernization that impact and benefit geospatial programs
- Connect IT professionals supporting geospatial programs: Improve coordination & collaboration relative to IT modernization 
- Share the courage to change (related to IT modernization) across the geospatial programs in the government.

**Aug 2023: An introduction to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) and how its used to explore NASA's Earth Observation Data**

_Tuesday, August 22nd, 2023 12:00 PM – 1 PM ET_

The **SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)** specification provides a common language for earth observation (EO) data. STAC is used to power data discovery, visualization, train ML models, and perform Earth data science. By putting data into STAC, we can dynamically select parts of large catalogs of data, combine them together, and derive insights in multiple ways.


This presentation will provide an introduction to STAC and its basic concepts of catalogs, collections and items. STAC has a wide ecosystem of adoption and use. It is being used by large data providers and private companies to manage archives of Earth Observation data, such as NASA, Microsoft's Planetary Computer and AWS Public Datasets. The software ecosystem for STAC, from metadata storage, to data services for query and visualization, is vast and growing. STAC makes it possible for data to be interoperable across interfaces and platforms.


We will demonstrate how STAC is used to power in-notebook data visualization through a new library called stac_ipyleaflet and how STAC is being used to drive configurable data storytelling in NASA's VEDA dashboard: https://earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard.


We hope more data providers across the federal government will adopt STAC so that data can be used across agencies with the same interfaces. We imagine this will help with developing applications which require combining data from multiple agencies, such as demographic data with weather data.

**Speakers:**

**Matt Hanson** is the Geospatial Engineering Lead at Element 84. Matt has had a keen passion in the imaging sciences nearly his whole life. From yearbook photographer to photographic and imaging science at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Matt has worked as a remote sensing data scientist and software developer for over 25 years. In the last several years, he has been a key contributor to the STAC specification and the development of the open-source ecosystem for cloud-native geospatial. A very active member of the community, Matt can be seen regularly at open-source and earth observation conferences and community events.


**Aimee Barciauskas** is a data engineer at Development Seed. She works NASA’s IMPACT to make Earth Observation data cloud-friendly. She has made significant contributions to NASA’s [Multi-Mission Algorithm and Analysis Platform](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/maap), [the Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA) Project](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda), is on the steering committee of the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) project, a member of NOAA's Data Access and Archive Requirements Working Group and is a chair of the [Earth Systems Information Partners (ESIP) Cloud Computing Cluster](https://wiki.esipfed.org/Cloud_Computing). 


**Alexandra Kirk** is a cloud engineer at Development Seed. She has experience building cloud-hosted pipelines that acquire, ingest, and index satellite and climatological data as well as the services to search and discover those datasets. She is passionate about building cloud tools and infrastructure to make geospatial data easier to find and use. Alexandra looks forward to expanding her open source contributions as a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) contributor. Alexandra has a BS in Earth and Planetary Sciences. She lives in New Mexico where she enjoys exploring the Rio Grande with her four legged best friend.


**Emma Paz** is an application developer at Development Seed. Passionate about geography, data, and code, she seeks to build valuable, map-centric tools that bring compelling data and visualizations to decision-makers. Emma loves challenges that include wrangling data together, leveraging databases for spatial analyses, simplifying workflows for researchers and technical users, and building interactive apps to engage the public. Emma has a B.S. in Biology from Kennesaw State University in Georgia. She started her geospatial career while obtaining her M.S. Environmental Science degree at the College of Charleston in South Carolina. Since then, she’s worked in private and public sector roles that have fueled her love of technology, leading her to exciting projects & responsibilities (like supporting Emergency Management operations for the City of Charleston during the Atlantic Hurricane Seasons) and enabling her to collaborate within. Across teams of people, she admires and continues to learn from.

## What We Do
The Geospatial Technology Community of Practice meets monthly for 30 minutes. In each meeting, a presenter will have the opportunity to share experiences for 15 minutes, followed by a 15 minute Q&A session. We work towards the following:

This CoP allows technical staff and leadership from across the government to share their experiences and lessons learned implementing DevSecOps and agile practices, as well as their efforts to migrate data and services to the cloud.

We aim to help reduce the learning curve associated with individual agencies, bureaus, and offices adopting cloud capabilities and DevSecOps practices.

The Geospatial Technology Community of Practice will allow agencies to learn from one another, sharing technical know-how. We also promote the adoption of industry best practices, like use of cloud, iterative delivery of product, and use of DevSecOps technologies and practices to save time and reduce costs, but also be a vehicle for innovation. As the U.S. government procures cloud capabilities, there is an opportunity to reduce cost, improve performance, and improve the speed to which data and digital services are provided to the public. An opportunity also exists to improve the speed at which software can be delivered to users.
