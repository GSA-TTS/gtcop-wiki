# The Geospatial Technology CoP (GtCoP)
[**Community Homepage**](https://github.com/GSA/gtcop-wiki/wiki)

The **Geospatial Technology Community of Practice (GtCoP)** will facilitate spreading lessons learned in applying modern digital capabilities as well as spreading the courage to change in adopting modern technology management and procurement practices.
- Provide a space for informal information sharing, ideation, and brainstorming necessary to innovate geospatial technologies in government
- Feedback mechanism for geospatial programs across the government to learn about stakeholder and user needs
- Share best technical practices related to digital modernization that impact and benefit geospatial programs
- Connect IT professionals supporting geospatial programs: Improve coordination & collaboration relative to IT modernization 
- Share the courage to change (related to IT modernization) across the geospatial programs in the government.

## What We Do
The Geospatial Technology Community of Practice meets monthly for 30 minutes. In each meeting, a presenter will have the opportunity to share experiences for 15 minutes, followed by a 15 minute Q&A session. We work towards the following:

This CoP allows technical staff and leadership from across the government to share their experiences and lessons learned implementing DevSecOps and agile practices, as well as their efforts to migrate data and services to the cloud.

We aim to help reduce the learning curve associated with individual agencies, bureaus, and offices adopting cloud capabilities and DevSecOps practices.

The Geospatial Technology Community of Practice will allow agencies to learn from one another, sharing technical know-how. We also promote the adoption of industry best practices, like use of cloud, iterative delivery of product, and use of DevSecOps technologies and practices to save time and reduce costs, but also be a vehicle for innovation. As the U.S. government procures cloud capabilities, there is an opportunity to reduce cost, improve performance, and improve the speed to which data and digital services are provided to the public. An opportunity also exists to improve the speed at which software can be delivered to users.
